as a client i want to
	click a cell

	have the action "add token" displayed in my "hand" tab from tools

	have the available tokens displayed in same tab in tools

given that i'm on the available add token -> available tokens screen on tools, i want to
	click an available token

	have the token added and displayed on the field

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
maybe it's worth to assign "owner" to tokens when they're added, then they'd always know who set them there
also could be easily changeable. we could use the clients connection id or something, from signalr hubs

as ttm facade contains the hub, method will be invoked there from client with needed info to perform the action, in this case, add a token
so something like "addtoken(position, tokenId)" on the ttm facade
facade can then load the token details from the database with the id and instantiate it, then send it to the board facade
board facade will place the token where it should and return the new state of the board, so that it can be sent to all clients frontend

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

next now is to handle the token loading from database
then we get back to the facade and handle how to send the updated board back to clients
